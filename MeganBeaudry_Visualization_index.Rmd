#First attempt 

This was an attempt at finding a code to make the y scale a percent. The code tested was (This code is not in a code chunk because the file will not knit wiht in incorrect code): 
scale_y_continous(labels=scales::percent)

This code chunk was on trying to find a way to convert data to percents
```{r}
help(percent)
HS_percent <- percent(divorcedata$HS_3544)
divorcedata$HS_percent = divorcedata$HS_3544*(100)
```

The follwing are attempts at converting data to percents. They did not list how they come up with "completed college" variable, so i had to try various different ways and then graph them to see if i got the same line that they did.
```{r}
divorcedata$HS_percent = divorcedata$HS_3544*(100)
divorcedata$HSP = divorcedata$HS_3544*(100) 
divorcedata$CSTotal = divorcedata$BAp_3544 + divorcedata$BAo_3544 + divorcedata$GD_3544
divorcedata$CSTotal2 = divorcedata$BAp_3544 + divorcedata$BAo_3544
divorcedata$CSP2 = divorcedata$CSTotal2*(100)
divorcedata$CSP = divorcedata$CSTotal*(100)
divorcedata$SCP = divorcedata$SC_3544*(100)
```

I am attempting at plotting just one line with a percent. Failed due to scale_y_ continous:
HS <- ggplot(divorcedata) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = HS_3544))
HS + scale_y_continous(labels=scales::percent)


This is an attempt at plotting one line
```{r}
HS <- ggplot(divorcedata) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = HS_3544))
```

Keeping code that i wanted to try to use to plot the percent, and the limit i wanted to set it too
```{r}
scale_y_continuous(name = "percent", limits = c(0, 25))
```

Here I tested out the scaling code with the plotting code. It was not working.
```{r}
ggplot(divorcedata) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = HS_3544)) + scale_y_continuous(name = "percent", limits = c(0, 25))
```

This is when i tried to make the graph of divorce rates by education
```{r}
ggplot(divorcedata) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = HS_3544))

```

I had to do further testing of various percents to match theirs. I wish more infomration had been given on how they went from teh dataset to the variables in the graph. 
```{r}
divorcedata$HS_percent = divorcedata$HS_3544*(100)
divorcedata$HSP = divorcedata$HS_3544*(100) 
divorcedata$CSTotal = divorcedata$BAp_3544 + divorcedata$BAo_3544 + divorcedata$GD_3544
divorcedata$CSTotal2 = divorcedata$BAp_3544 + divorcedata$BAo_3544
divorcedata$CSP2 = divorcedata$CSTotal2*(100)
divorcedata$CSP = divorcedata$CSTotal*(100)
divorcedata$SCP = divorcedata$SC_3544*(100)
```

Succesful maping with one percent. now time to add in more lines
```{r}
ggplot(divorcedata) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = HSP)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "percent", limits = c(0, 25))
```

Figuring out how to get colors to match the best
```{r}
ggplot(divorcedata) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = HSP, color = "HSP")) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = SCP, color = "Some College")) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = CSP2, color = "all college")) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "percent", limits = c(0, 25)) 
```


The final percents for the other two variables
```{r}
divorcedata$HSP = divorcedata$HS_3544*(100) 
divorcedata$SCP = divorcedata$SC_3544*(100)
divorcedata$BAP = divorcedata$BAp_3544*(100)
```

Trying to get labels
```{r}
ggplot(divorcedata) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = HSP), color = 'blue') +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = SCP), color = 'light blue') +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = BAP), color = 'purple') +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "percent", limits = c(0, 25)) +
  ggtitle("Divorce Rates by Education: Ages 35-44") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "education level", breaks=c("HSP", "SCP", "BAP"), labels=c("High School", "Some College", "Bachelors")) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

```

More attempts at labeling on graph (not included in a code chunk because file will not knit)
ggplot(divorcedata) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = HSP), color = 'blue') +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = SCP), color = 'light blue') +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = BAP), color = 'purple') +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "percent", limits = c(0, 25)) +
  ggtitle("Divorce Rates by Education: Ages 35-44") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "education level") +
  geom_dl(aes(label = Education), method = list(dl.combine("first.points", "last.points"), cex = 0.8)

still working, but can't get the labels exaclty how I would like them
```{r}
ggplot(divorcedata) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = HSP, label = "High School"), color = 'blue') +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = SCP), color = 'light blue') +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = BAP), color = 'purple') +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "percent", limits = c(0, 25)) +
  ggtitle("Divorce Rates by Education: Ages 35-44") 
```

#FINAL PRODUCT BELOW

AND FINALLY ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER. The code below produced my most successful figure! I also attempted to match the colors to the one online, which only used shades of blue.
```{r}
ggplot(divorcedata) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = HSP), color = 'cyan') +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = SCP), color = 'navy blue') +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = BAP), color = 'light blue') +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "percent", limits = c(0, 25)) +
  labs(title = "Divorce Rates by Education", subtitle = "Ages 35-44", x = "years") +
  annotate("text", x= 1990, y = 23, label = "Some college") +
  annotate("text", x= 2000, y = 13, label = "High school or less") +
  annotate("text", x= 2005, y = 5, label = "College Graduates") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  geom_segment(aes(2000, 6, xend = 2000, yend =10.1)) +
  geom_segment(aes(2000, 15, xend = 2000, yend = 17)) +
  geom_segment(aes(1990, 17, xend = 1990, yend = 21))
